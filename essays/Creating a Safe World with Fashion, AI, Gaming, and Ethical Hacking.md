As an intermediate software engineer with a strong foundation in JavaScript, Java, and TypeScript, my passion for pushing the boundaries of technology drives me towards specialized fields such as artificial intelligence (AI), game development, and cybersecurity, particularly offensive hacking for governmental applications. My curiosity and enthusiasm for these areas are not only fueled by their technical challenges but also by their potential to significantly impact society.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, which is laying the theoretical and practical groundwork necessary for my ambitious goals. One of these goals is to develop "FasterFashionAI," a program designed to revolutionize the fashion industry by reducing waste and consumption through intelligent inventory management and trend prediction. Simultaneously, I aspire to create a video game that challenges the mind, altering the common perceptions about video games by designing experiences that enhance cognitive functions rather than exploit them. These projects reflect my broader commitment to utilizing technology for societal benefits whether that's through sustainable practices or educational entertainment.

To further my expertise and expand my skill set, I am eager to delve into C++ and other programming languages and tools that are pivotal in areas like game development and AI. Moreover, obtaining top industry certifications will be crucial. Certifications such as Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP), and certifications from NVIDIA for AI and deep learning, would equip me with the credentials to advance in offensive cybersecurity and AI applications. My ultimate motivation is to harness technology not only to solve practical problems but to ensure a safer, smarter, and more sustainable world. Through continuous learning and application of my skills, I aim to contribute meaningfully to fields that have the power to transform how we live and interact with our digital and physical environments.
