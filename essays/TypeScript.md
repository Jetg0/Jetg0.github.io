As a Computer Science student and an intermediate Java developer, I recently started using TypeScript, which is a language that has a different edge over JavaScript. Comparing and contrasting these features to Java while using a software engineers perspective will be dove into for this reflection. 

The transition from Java, being that it is an object oriented based language to TypeScript, which is similar to JavaScript- uses static types was easier to learn than I expected it to be. The syntax of TypeScript was fairly familiar and the structure of the code was comparable to Java. The provided code below is an excellent example of the differences in TypeScript.

let message: string = "Hello TypeScript, my name is Josh";

The line above is simple but not available in JavaScript which is important because the early detection of bugs is better than the long runtime error process in Java in addition to compiling. 

ES6 features were also an important factor while learning TypeScript. The process of learning classes, function of the arrows, and the modules were more concise in terms of syntax and legible. 

const addingNumbers = (a: number, b: number): number => a  + b;

The example above,  uses the arrow function in TypeScript which is clear and safe without unnecessary clutter. This allows for better management of larger coded projects. 

Overall, the main takeaways with JavaScript and TypeScript are the faster run times and declutter that TypeScript has to offer. TypeScript was ultimately fun and refreshing to learn as I reminisced of the code being similar to JavaScript.
