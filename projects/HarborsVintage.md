  Harbors Vintage is not only a Vintage clothing store but it also includes many other things that are beneficial to the community. Harbors Vintage excells at promoting small vendors and businesses which are locally owned. My team created a new outlet branching from Harbors Vintage by which is called "3rd Space". The purpose of the third space is to create a sense of community outside consumerism. These traits include a; community bookshelf, place to lounge, place to enjoy music, place to watch movies, or be connected with the owner, etc.
